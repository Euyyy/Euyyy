## How to Get Your Token ID:
To retrieve your Discord token, you can use the following script in your browser’s developer console:

```js
(webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([
    [""],
    {},
    (e) => {
        m = [];
        for (let c in e.c) m.push(e.c[c]);
    },
]),
m)
    .find((m) => m?.exports?.default?.getToken !== void 0)
    .exports.default.getToken();
```
Note: Use your token responsibly and be aware of Discord’s guidelines on bot usage. Misuse of your token can lead to account suspension.
